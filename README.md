# IRADUKUNDA JEAN DE DIEU'S WORK

## to be able to interact with this work, you can:

    - clone the [repository](https://github.com/JeanIrad/taskForce.git)
    - open it in your favorite code Editor but more preferrable is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - run the index.html file in your browser, you can use live server extension in vs code if you are using one.
    - try hovering the images, adding the more images and refreshing the pages to see how the simple galley collection handles those changes.
    - finally, try responsiveness by entering in dev model or inspect mode and choose any type of mobile you prefer.
